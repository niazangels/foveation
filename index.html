            <p>
                A shoemaker, <span class="highlight" data-importance="90">by no fault of his own, became so poor that at
                    last he had nothing left but enough leather for one pair of shoes</span>. So in the evening, he cut
                the leather into the shape of the shoes, and he left his work on the table to finish in the morning. He
                lay down quietly in his bed, and <span class="highlight" data-importance="80">before he fell asleep he
                    asked God to help him</span>.</p>

            <p>
                In the morning, <span class="highlight" data-importance="85">he saw the two shoes standing quite
                    finished on his table</span>. He was astounded, and did not know what to make of it. He took the
                shoes in his hands to look at them more closely and <span class="highlight" data-importance="70">he saw
                    that they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them</span>.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-importance="75">Soon after, a customer came in to the shop, and paid more
                    than the usual price. Now the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for two pairs of
                    shoes</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                That night, he cut out the leather, and <span class="highlight" data-importance="80">the next morning he
                    saw that the shoes were already made</span>. There was no shortage of customers who wanted the
                shoes, and <span class="highlight" data-importance="75">the shoemaker soon had enough to buy leather for
                    four pairs of shoes</span>.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-importance="85">Soon he was no longer poor, and he even became quite
                    rich</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now one evening, not long before Christmas, <span class="highlight" data-importance="90">the man said to
                    his wife: "Let's stay up tonight to see who it is that lends us this helping hand?"</span></p>

            <p>
                The woman liked the idea, and <span class="highlight" data-importance="70">they hid themselves in a
                    corner of the room behind some clothes and watched</span>.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-importance="95">When it was midnight, two little elves came into the room,
                    both without any clothes on</span>. They took all the work which was cut out before them and began
                to stitch, sew, and hammer so skillfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker
                could not turn away his eyes for astonishment. <span class="highlight" data-importance="75">They did not
                    stop until all was done and stood finished on the table, and then they ran quickly away</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next morning <span class="highlight" data-importance="85">the woman said: "The little men have made
                    us rich, and we really must show that we are grateful for it. I will make them little shirts, coats,
                    vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings. You can help too – make them two
                    little pairs of shoes."</span></p>

            <p>
                The man agreed, and <span class="highlight" data-importance="80">one night, they laid their presents
                    altogether on the table instead of the cut out work</span>.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-importance="85">At midnight they came bounding in, but as they did not find
                    any leather cut out, but only the pretty little articles of clothing, they were at first puzzled –
                    and then delighted</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-importance="80">"Now we are boys so fine to see,
                    Why should we longer cobblers be?"</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                They danced and skipped and leaped over chairs and benches. <span class="highlight"
                    data-importance="95">From that time on they came no more, but as long as the shoemaker lived, all
                    went well with him, and all his business prospered</span>.</p>
