    <h1>The Elves and the Shoemaker</h1>
    <article>
        <Para>
            A shoemaker, <Highlight class="highlight" importance=90>by no fault of his own, became so poor that at
                last he had nothing left but enough leather for one pair of shoes</Highlight>. So in the evening, he cut
            the leather into the shape of the shoes, and he left his work on the table to finish in the morning. He
            lay down quietly in his bed, and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=80>before he fell asleep he
                asked God to help him</Highlight>.
        </Para>

        <Para>
            In the morning, <Highlight class="highlight" importance=85>he saw the two shoes standing quite
                finished on his table</Highlight>. He was astounded, and did not know what to make of it. He took the
            shoes in his hands to look at them more closely and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=70>he saw
                that they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them</Highlight>.</Para>

        <Para>
            <Highlight class="highlight" importance=75>Soon after, a customer came in to the shop, and paid more
                than the usual price. Now the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for two pairs of
                shoes</Highlight>.
        </Para>

        <Para>
            That night, he cut out the leather, and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=80>the next morning he
                saw that the shoes were already made</Highlight>. There was no shortage of customers who wanted the
            shoes, and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=75>the shoemaker soon had enough to buy leather for
                four pairs of shoes</Highlight>.</Para>

        <Para>
            <Highlight class="highlight" importance=85>Soon he was no longer poor, and he even became quite
                rich</Highlight>.
        </Para>

        <Para>
            Now one evening, not long before Christmas, <Highlight class="highlight" importance=90>the man said to
                his wife: "Let's stay up tonight to see who it is that lends us this helping hand?"</Highlight></Para>

        <Para>
            The woman liked the idea, and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=70>they hid themselves in a
                corner of the room behind some clothes and watched</Highlight>.</Para>

        <Para>
            <Highlight class="highlight" importance=95>When it was midnight, two little elves came into the room,
                both without any clothes on</Highlight>. They took all the work which was cut out before them and began
            to stitch, sew, and hammer so skillfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker
            could not turn away his eyes for astonishment. <Highlight class="highlight" importance=75>They did not
                stop until all was done and stood finished on the table, and then they ran quickly away</Highlight>.
        </Para>

        <Para>
            The next morning <Highlight class="highlight" importance=85>the woman said: "The little men have made
                us rich, and we really must show that we are grateful for it. I will make them little shirts, coats,
                vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings. You can help too – make them two
                little pairs of shoes."</Highlight></Para>

        <Para>
            The man agreed, and <Highlight class="highlight" importance=80>one night, they laid their presents
                altogether on the table instead of the cut out work</Highlight>.</Para>

        <Para>
            <Highlight class="highlight" importance=85>At midnight they came bounding in, but as they did not find
                any leather cut out, but only the pretty little articles of clothing, they were at first puzzled –
                and then delighted</Highlight>.
        </Para>

        <Para>
            <Highlight class="highlight" importance=80>"Now we are boys so fine to see,
                Why should we longer cobblers be?"</Highlight>
        </Para>

        <Para>
            They danced and skipped and leaped over chairs and benches. <Highlight class="highlight"
                importance=95>From that time on they came no more, but as long as the shoemaker lived, all
                went well with him, and all his business prospered</Highlight>.
